This is a mod i have been working on for a few hours. Basically if you got banned or cant access psn and your friends category is empty, you can use this mod to have the basic functions of the friends category (block list,
add new friend etc)

BUT HERES THE CATCH it uses facebook to achive them... eg, message box would take you to your psn messages normally but now it will redirect you to your facebook mesages instead! basically its facebook integration into the xmb.
